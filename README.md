## Preplanning

### Wire-Frame

Below is the initial wireframe created during pre-planning

### Schema

Our initial data set and api calls are not heavy on computation. So we used a NoSQL approach to storing and manipulating JSON objects. Our initial object structure allows us to grab related data and return it to the user based on their api call.

```json
{
	"archetype_id": 1,
	"drive": "leave a mark",
	"aspect": "ego",
	"method": "mastery",
	"shadow": "end justify the means",
	"name": "warrior",
	"alias": "hero",
	"role": "student",
	"color": "red"
}
```

## Technology

### Material-UI

Coming from a React background, Vue was fairly straightforward to learn. Many ideas are parallel and of those that are not, they are fairly intuitive.

The organization of files in Vue is better suited to the way I personally work best in programming.
